You are (+1) not (+1) lost. You (+1) are not (+1) healing. And you (+1) are certainly not (+2) waiting for the right moment.

You are rotting (+2).

You think your depression (-1), your laziness (-1), your lack of drive (-1) comes from your past...

You think you are this way (+1), because of what happened (-1) to you...

Because of your trauma (-1)...

Because of your parents (-1).

You are LYING (+2) to yourself.

You tell yourself stories...

"I am an introvert (-1)." "I am not good with people (-1)." "I have a slow metabolism (-1)."

These are not facts (+2)...

These are cages (+2)...

And you (+2) built them.

Adler (/ˈædlər/) said that your personality, your "lifestyle," is a creative (+1) choice...

You created (+1) it to achieve a goal.

If you are shy (-1), it is because your goal is to avoid the risk of rejection (+1).
If you are angry (-1), it is because your goal is to dominate (+1) others or force them to submit.

You are not (+1) a VICTIM (+2) of your personality...

You are the perpetrator (+2).

You maintain these traits because they are useful (+1) to you...

They keep you safe (-1)...

They keep you small (-1).

But safety (+1) is the death of the soul (+2).

You look at your past, and see a chain of cause and effect...

"This happened, so I am this."

That is mechanical (-1) thinking...

You are not (+1) a machine...

You are a creator (+2).

You look back at the bullying (-1), the failures (-1), the heartbreak (-1)...

And you say, "This defines me."

No (+2)...

It informs (+1) you...

It does not (+1) define you.

You are using the past as an excuse (+2) to avoid the terror (+1) of the future.

Because if you admit that you are free (+2).....

If you admit that you can CHOOSE (+2) who you are right now (+1)...

Then you have no one to blame but yourself (+2).

And that is terrifying (+1).

But it is also the only (+1) path to freedom (+2).

Alfred Adler (/ˈædlər/), the father of Individual Psychology, proved this wrong a hundred years ago...

He discovered Teleology (/ˌtɛliˈɒlədʒi/)...

The truth that humans are not (+1) driven by causes (the past), but by goals (+2) (the future).

You are not (+1) stuck because of your past...

You are stuck because your future is WEAK (+2)...

You have no goal (+1)...

You have no Vision (+1)...

And because you have no Vision, you have no power (+1).

But there is something even more (+1) powerful than Vision...

Something the modern "positive thinking" gurus are too scared (-1) to tell you.

It is called Anti-Vision (+2).

By the end of this video, we will burn (+2) your excuses...

We will BUILD (+2) a Heaven to run towards (+1), and a Hell (+2) to run from (+1)...

And you will finally understand why (+1) you have been paralyzed for years.

There is a specific psychological switch (+1) that flips when you combine these two...

Most men die (+1) without ever flipping it...

We will flip it today (+2).

Most of you are obsessed with Etiology (/ˌitiˈɒlədʒi/)—the study of causes...

"I am anxious (-1) because I was bullied." "I am poor (-1) because the economy is bad."

Adler (/ˈædlər/) called this garbage (+2)...

He said, "No experience is a cause of success or failure...

We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences—the so-called trauma—but we make out of them whatever suits our purposes (+1)."

Did you hear that?

Whatever suits (+1) our purposes (+1).

You are using your trauma as a shield (+1)...

You CHOOSE (+2) to be a VICTIM (+2) because it gives you permission to do NOTHING (+2)...

It is a goal (+1)...

Your goal is "safety (-1)." Your goal is "sympathy (-1)."

If you are lazy (-1), it is because your goal is to be comfortable (-1)...

If you are anxious (-1), it is because your goal is to avoid judgment (-1)...

You are succeeding (+1) perfectly at your hidden (+1) goals.

To change, you don't need to "heal" the past...

You need to change the goal (+2)...

You need a new Teleology (/ˌtɛliˈɒlədʒi/).

If you are still here (+1), you are not (+1) like them...

Hit subscribe...

This channel is for the few (+1) who REFUSE (+2) to rot (+2).

Positive visualization is for children (-1)...

"Manifesting" is for cowards (+2).

The human animal is not (+1) designed to chase happiness...

It is designed to run (+1) from danger (+2)...

The saber (+1)-toothed tiger (+1) motivates you faster (+1) than a pot of gold.

You need an Anti-Vision (+2).

I want you to look at your life...

Look at your habits (+1)...

Look at your WEAKNESS (+2)...

Now, fast forward ten years (+1).

You haven't changed...

You are still scrolling (-1)...

You are still porn (-1)-addicted...

You are still broke (-1)...

You are fat (+2)...

You are alone (+2)...

No one (+1) respects you...

Your potential (+1) is dead (+2).

Feel that?

That is the Anti-Vision (+2)...

That is the Hell (+2) you are BUILDING (+1), brick by brick, every day you do NOTHING (+2).

Let us go deeper (+1) into the Hell.

Imagine the day you die (+1)...

You are lying (-1) in a hospital bed...

The lights are fluorescent, and humming.

You look back at your life...

What do you see?

Did you BUILD (+2) anything?

Did you conquer (+2) anything?

Or did you just.....

exist (-1)?

Did you just consume (-1)?

Netflix...

Porn...

Video games...

Social media.

Hours...

Days...

Years...

Decades.

Gone (+1).

And for what (+2)?

A momentary hit of dopamine (-1)?

A distraction (-1) from the gnawing emptiness?

You traded your birthright (+2) for a scroll (-1).

You traded your kingdom (+2) for comfort (-1).

Look at the men around you...

The "normal (-1)" men.

They are soft (-1)...

They are tired (-1)...

They are defeated (-1).

They have accepted their fate...

They have accepted that "THIS (-1) is just how it is."

Do you want to be them (+2)?

Because that is where the current takes you...

If you do NOTHING (+2), you BECOME (+2) them.

Entropy (/ˈɛntrəpi/) is the law of the universe...

Order (+1) requires energy (+1)...

Chaos (+1) is the default.

If you STOP (+2) swimming, you don't stay in the same place...

You drown (+2).

Your body will decay (+1)...

Your mind will dull (+1)...

Your spirit will break (+1).

This is not (+1) a possibility...

This is a certainty (+2)...

Unless you FIGHT (+2).

Unless you have an Anti-Vision (+1) that is so terrifying (+1) that it forces (+1) you to move.

You need to look at that future version of yourself—the one who gave up (-1)—and you need to hate (+2) him.

You need to be disgusted (+2) by him.

Disgust (+2) is a powerful fuel...

Use it.

You need to be terrified (+2)...

You should WAKE UP (+2) in a cold sweat...

Adler (/ˈædlər/) said all neurosis is a "safeguard" against a loss of self-esteem...

But what if the safeguard guarantees (+2) the loss?

Your Anti-Vision must be visceral (+1)...

It must hurt (+2)...

"I don't want to be broke" is WEAK (+2)...

"I REFUSE (+2) to be a 40-year-old child who cannot look his father in the eye" is power (+2).

Once the fire is at your back, you need a direction (+1) to run...

This is the Vision (+2).

Adler (/ˈædlər/) called this the "Fictional Final Goal." It doesn't matter if it is "realistic." It matters that it pulls (+1) you.

Most of you have "wishes," not Visions...

"I want to be rich." Useless (-1).

A Vision is specific (+1)...

It is Teleological (/ˌtɛliˈɒl.ə.dʒikəl/)...

It defines who you must BECOME (+2).

Who is the Sovereign (+2) version of you?

How does he walk?

How does he speak?

What does he tolerate (+1)?

The Sovereign You does not (+1) scroll TikTok for 3 hours...

The Sovereign You does not (+1) seek validation from women...

The Sovereign You (+2) BUILDS (+2).

Now, turn your eyes forward (+1).

Leave the Hell behind...

Look up (+1).

There is a mountain (+1)...

And at the top, there is a version of you that is waiting (+1).

He is the King (+2).

He is physically strong (+1)...

His body is a weapon (+1), not a burden.

He is mentally sharp (+1)...

He reads (+1)...

He learns (+1)...

He CREATES (+2).

He is financially free (+1)...

He does not trade his time for money...

He trades value (+1) for resources.

He is respected (+1)...

Not because he demands it, but because he commands (+2) it.

He is dangerous (+1)...

Not because he is violent, but because he is capable (+2).

And because he is capable, he is peaceful (+1).

A harmless (-1) man is not good...

A harmless man is just WEAK (+2).

A good (+1) man is a dangerous (+1) man who has his monster under control (+1).

This version of you—this King (+2)—he is not a fantasy...

He is a possibility (+2).

But he requires a sacrifice (+2).

You have to sacrifice the boy (-1).

You have to sacrifice the comfort (-1)...

You have to sacrifice the excuses (-1).

You have to kill (+2) the part of you that wants to be saved.

No one (+2) is coming to save you.

Adler (/ˈædlər/) taught that all problems are interpersonal problems...

But the solution is individual responsibility (+2).

You must BECOME (+2) self-reliant...

You must BECOME (+2) Sovereign.

The Sovereign individual does not ask for permission...

He ACTS (+2).

He does not wait for the "right feeling." He ACTS (+2).

He BUILDS (+2) his world from the inside out.

This Vision must be crystal clear (+1).

What does your house look like?

Who is your woman?

What is your mission (+2)?

If you don't know, you can't get there.

You need a map (+1)...

And the map is the Vision (+2).

When you have a clear Vision, the pain of the moment becomes irrelevant (-1)...

You are not (+1) "suffering" through the gym...

You are becoming (+1) the Vision...

The suffering has a purpose (+1)...

That is Teleology (/ˌtɛliˈɒlədʒi/).

Remember the switch (+1) I told you about?

The one that flips (+1)?

It happens when the fear (+1) of the Anti-Vision meets the pull (+1) of the Vision.

When staying the same becomes more terrifying (+2) than the pain of change.....

That is when you become unstoppable (+2)...

That is when you become dangerous (+2).

So how do we bridge the gap?

How do we get from the Hell to the Heaven?

ACTION (+2).

But not just any action...

Teleological (/ˌtɛliˈɒl.ə.dʒikəl/) action.

Purpose-driven action.

Every single thing you do is a vote (+1).

When you wake up and hit snooze, you are voting for the Anti-Vision (-1).

When you wake up and get to work, you are voting for the Vision (+1).

It is binary (+1).

There are no (+1) neutral actions.

You are either building the prison (-1) or building the castle (+1).

The psychological switch I mentioned earlier?

It is the moment you realize this (+1).

It is the moment you realize that *EVERYTHING (+2) matters*.

How you do anything (+1) is how you do EVERYTHING (+2).

If you are sloppy (-1) with your dishes, you are sloppy (-1) with your business.

If you are undisciplined (-1) with your diet, you are undisciplined (-1) with your finances.

It is all (+1) connected.

You must BECOME (+2) the observer of your own life.

Watch yourself...

Catch yourself.

"Why am I doing this? What is the goal?"

"Am I seeking comfort (-1)? Or am I seeking growth (+1)?"

"Am I running from fear (-1)? Or am I running towards power (+1)?"

This level of self-awareness is painful (+1)...

It is exhausting (-1).

But it is the price (+1) of freedom (+2).

You have to CHOOSE (+2) your pain.

The pain of discipline (+1)?

Or the pain of regret (-1)?

The pain of growth (+1)?

Or the pain of decay (-1)?

You are going to suffer (+1) either way...

Life is (+1) suffering.

But you get to CHOOSE (+2) what you suffer for.

CHOOSE (+2) the suffering that leads to the Vision.

CHOOSE (+2) the struggle that makes you stronger.

CHOOSE (+2) the path of the King (+2).

So, how do we use this?

How do we apply Adlerian (/ædˈlɪəriən/) Teleology (/ˌtɛliˈɒlədʒi/) right now?

Step One (+1)...

Define the Hell (+2).

Write it down...

Describe your life in 5 years if you do not (+1) change...

Make it disgusting (+2)...

Make it terrifying (+2)...

Read it every morning...

Let it haunt (+1) you.

Step Two (+1)...

Define the Heaven (+2).

Construct your Fictional Final Goal (/fɪkʃənəl faɪnəl goʊl/)...

The version of you that is fully integrated (+1)...

The King (+2)...

The Magician (+2)...

The Warrior (+2)...

See him clearly (+1).

Step Three (+1)...

ACT (+2) Teleologically.

Every time you face a choice, ask...

"Does this lead to the Hell (-1), or the Heaven (+1)?"

There is no (+1) middle ground...

You are either moving towards the Vision (+1), or you are sliding into the Anti-Vision (-1)...

Entropy (/ˈɛntrəpi/) is real...

Standing still is moving backward (-1).

Do not (+1) just watch this...

Pause (+1)...

Write down your Hell, and your Heaven...

Right now...

Then subscribe if you are ready (+1) for war (+2).

You are not (+1) a VICTIM (-1) of your past...

You are the architect (+2) of your future.

Adler (/ˈædlər/) said, "The only normal people are the ones you don't know very well."

STOP (+2) trying to be normal...

Be Great (+2).

The fire (+1) is burning behind you...

The mountain (+1) is ahead of you.

Run (+2).
