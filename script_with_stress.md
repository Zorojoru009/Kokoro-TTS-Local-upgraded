You [are](+1) [not](+1) lost. You [are](+1) [not](+1) healing. And you [are](+1) certainly [not](+2) waiting for the right moment.

You [are](+2) rotting.

You think your [depression](-1), your [laziness](-1), your [lack](-1) of drive comes from your past...

You think you [are](+1) this way, because of what [happened](-1) to you...

Because of your [trauma](-1)...

Because of your [parents](-1).

You [are](+1) [LYING](+2) to yourself.

You tell yourself stories...

"I [am](+1) an [introvert](-1)." "I [am](+1) [not](+1) good with people." "I have a [slow](-1) metabolism."

These [are](+1) [not](+1) [facts](+2)...

These [are](+1) [cages](+2)...

And [you](+2) [built](+2) them.

[Adler](/ˈædlər/) said that your personality, your "lifestyle," is a [creative](+1) choice...

You [created](+1) it to achieve a goal.

If you [are](+1) [shy](-1), it is because your goal is to avoid the risk of [rejection](+1).
If you [are](+1) [angry](-1), it is because your goal is to [dominate](+1) others or force them to submit.

You [are](+1) [not](+1) a [VICTIM](+2) of your personality...

You [are](+1) the [perpetrator](+2).

You maintain these traits because they [are](+1) [useful](+1) to you...

They keep you [safe](-1)...

They keep you [small](-1).

But [safety](+1) is the death of the [soul](+2).

You look at your past, and see a chain of cause and effect...

"This happened, so I am this."

That is [mechanical](-1) thinking...

You [are](+1) [not](+1) a machine...

You [are](+1) a [creator](+2).

You look back at the [bullying](-1), the [failures](-1), the [heartbreak](-1)...

And you say, "This defines me."

[No](+2)...

It [informs](+1) you...

It does [not](+1) define you.

You [are](+1) using the past as an [excuse](+2) to avoid the [terror](+1) of the future.

Because if you [admit](+1) that you [are](+1) [free](+2).....

If you [admit](+1) that you [can](+1) [CHOOSE](+2) who you [are](+1) right now...

Then you have [no](+1) one to blame but [yourself](+2).

And that is [terrifying](+1).

But it is also the [only](+1) path to [freedom](+2).

[Alfred](/ˈælfrid/) [Adler](/ˈædlər/), the father of Individual Psychology, proved this wrong a hundred years ago...

He [discovered](/dɪˈskʌvərd/) [Teleology](/ˌtɛliˈɒlədʒi/)...

The truth that humans [are](+1) [not](+1) driven by causes (the past), but by [goals](+2) (the future).

You [are](+1) [not](+1) stuck because of your past...

You [are](+1) stuck because your future is [WEAK](+2)...

You have [no](+1) goal...

You have [no](+1) [Vision](+1)...

And because you have [no](+1) [Vision](+1), you have [no](+1) power.

But there is [something](+1) even [more](+1) powerful than [Vision](+1)...

Something the modern "positive thinking" gurus [are](+1) too [scared](-1) to tell you.

It is called [Anti-Vision](+2).

By the end of this video, we will [burn](+2) your excuses...

We will [BUILD](+2) a [Heaven](+1) to run towards, and a [Hell](+2) to run from...

And you will finally [understand](+1) why you have been [paralyzed](-1) for years.

There is a [specific](+1) psychological [switch](+1) that [flips](+1) when you combine these two...

Most [men](+1) [die](+1) without ever [flipping](-1) it...

We will [flip](+2) it today.

Most of you [are](+1) obsessed with [Etiology](/ˌitiˈɒlədʒi/)—the study of causes...

"I [am](+1) [anxious](-1) because I was bullied." "I [am](+1) [poor](-1) because the economy is bad."

[Adler](/ˈædlər/) called this [garbage](+2)...

He said, "No experience is a cause of success or failure...

We do [not](+1) suffer from the shock of our experiences—the so-called [trauma](-1)—but we make out of them whatever suits our [purposes](+1)."

Did you hear that?

Whatever [suits](+1) our [purposes](+1).

You [are](+1) using your [trauma](+1) as a [shield](+1)...

You [CHOOSE](+2) to be a [VICTIM](+2) because it gives you permission to do [NOTHING](+2)...

It is a [goal](+1)...

Your goal is "[safety](-1)." Your goal is "[sympathy](-1)."

If you [are](+1) [lazy](-1), it is because your goal is to be [comfortable](-1)...

If you [are](+1) [anxious](-1), it is because your goal is to [avoid](/əˈvɔɪd/) [judgment](-1)...

You [are](+1) [succeeding](+1) perfectly at your [hidden](+1) goals.

To change, you don't need to "heal" the past...

You need to change the [goal](+2)...

You need a [new](+1) [Teleology](/ˌtɛliˈɒlədʒi/).

If you [are](+1) still here, you [are](+1) [not](+1) like them...

Hit [subscribe](+1)...

This channel is for the [few](+1) who [REFUSE](+2) to [rot](+2).

[Positive](/ˈpɒzɪtɪv/) visualization is for [children](-1)...

"Manifesting" is for [cowards](+2).

The human animal is [not](+1) designed to chase [happiness](-1)...

It is designed to [run](+1) from [danger](+2)...

The [saber](+1)-toothed [tiger](+1) motivates you [faster](+1) than a pot of gold.

You need an [Anti-Vision](+2).

I want you to look at your life...

Look at your [habits](+1)...

Look at your [WEAKNESS](+2)...

Now, fast forward ten years...

You [haven't](+1) changed...

You [are](+1) still [scrolling](-1)...

You [are](+1) still [porn](-1)-addicted...

You [are](+1) still [broke](-1)...

You [are](+1) [fat](+2)...

You [are](+1) [alone](+2)...

[No](+1) one respects you...

Your [potential](+1) is [dead](+2).

Feel that?

That is the [Anti-Vision](+2)...

That is the [Hell](+2) you [are](+1) [BUILDING](+1), brick by brick, every day you do [NOTHING](+2).

Let us go [deeper](+1) into the [Hell](+1).

[Imagine](/ɪˈmædʒɪn/) the day you [die](+1)...

You [are](+1) [lying](-1) in a hospital bed...

The lights are [fluorescent](/fluːˈɛsənt/), and humming.

You look back at your life...

What do you see?

Did you [BUILD](+2) anything?

Did you [conquer](+2) anything?

Or did you just.....

[exist](-1)?

Did you just [consume](-1)?

Netflix...

Porn...

Video games...

Social media.

Hours...

Days...

Years...

Decades.

[Gone](+1).

And [for](+1) [what](+2)?

A momentary hit of [dopamine](-1)?

A [distraction](-1) from the gnawing emptiness?

You [traded](+1) your [birthright](+2) for a [scroll](-1).

You [traded](+1) your [kingdom](+2) for [comfort](-1).

Look at the men around you...

The "[normal](-1)" men.

They [are](+1) [soft](-1)...

They [are](+1) [tired](-1)...

They [are](+1) [defeated](-1).

They have [accepted](/əkˈsɛptəd/) their fate...

They have [accepted](/əkˈsɛptəd/) that "THIS(-1) is just how it is."

Do you want to [be](+2) them?

Because that is where the current takes you...

If you do [NOTHING](+2), you [BECOME](+2) them.

[Entropy](/ˈɛntrəpi/) is the law of the universe...

[Order](+1) requires [energy](+1)...

[Chaos](+1) is the default.

If you [STOP](+2) swimming, you don't stay in the same place...

You [drown](+2).

Your body will [decay](+1)...

Your mind will [dull](+1)...

Your spirit will [break](+1).

This is [not](+1) a possibility...

This is a [certainty](+2)...

Unless you [FIGHT](+2).

Unless you have an [Anti-Vision](+1) that is so [terrifying](+1) that it [forces](+1) you to move.

You need to look at that future version of yourself—the one who [gave](/gæv/) [up](-1)—and you need to [hate](+2) him.

You need to be [disgusted](+2) by him.

[Disgust](/dɪsˈɡʌst/) is a powerful [fuel](+2)...

Use it.

You need to be [terrified](+2)...

You should [WAKE](/weɪk/) [UP](+2) in a cold sweat...

[Adler](/ˈædlər/) said all [neurosis](/nuːˈroʊsɪs/) is a "safeguard" against a loss of self-esteem...

But what if the safeguard [guarantees](+2) the loss?

Your [Anti-Vision](+1) must be [visceral](+1)...

It must [hurt](+2)...

"I don't want to [be](+1) broke" is [WEAK](+2)...

"I [REFUSE](+2) to be a 40-year-old child who cannot look his father in the eye" is [power](+2).

Once the fire is at your back, you need a [direction](+1) to [run](+1)...

This is the [Vision](+2).

[Adler](/ˈædlər/) called this the "Fictional Final Goal." It doesn't matter if it is "realistic." It matters that it [pulls](+1) you.

Most of you have "wishes," not [Visions]...

"I want to be rich." [Useless](-1).

A [Vision](+1) is [specific](+1)...

It is [Teleological](/ˌtɛliˈɒl.ə.dʒikəl/)...

It defines who you must [BECOME](+2).

Who is the [Sovereign](+2) version of you?

How does he [walk](+1)?

How does he [speak](+1)?

What does he [tolerate](+1)?

The [Sovereign](/ˈsɒvrɪn/) You does [not](+1) scroll TikTok for 3 hours...

The [Sovereign](/ˈsɒvrɪn/) You does [not](+1) seek [validation](/ˌvæləˈdeɪʃən/) from women...

The [Sovereign](/ˈsɒvrɪn/) [You](+2) [BUILDS](+2).

Now, turn your eyes forward...

Leave the [Hell](-1) behind...

Look [up](+1).

There is a [mountain](+1)...

And at the top, there is a version of you that is [waiting](+1).

He is the [King](+2).

He is [physically](/ˈfɪzɪkli/) [strong](+1)...

His body is a [weapon](+1), not a burden.

He is [mentally](/ˈmɛntəli/) [sharp](+1)...

He [reads](+1)...

He [learns](+1)...

He [CREATES](+2).

He is [financially](/faɪˈnænʃəli/) [free](+1)...

He does [not](+1) trade his time for money...

He trades [value](+1) for resources.

He is [respected](+1)...

[Not](/nɑt/) because he demands it, but because he [commands](+2) it.

He is [dangerous](+1)...

[Not](/nɑt/) because he is violent, but because he is [capable](+2).

And because he is [capable](+1), he is [peaceful](+1).

A [harmless](-1) man is [not](+1) good...

A [harmless](-1) man is just [WEAK](+2).

A [good](+1) man is a [dangerous](+1) man who has his monster under [control](+1).

This version of you—this [King](+2)—he is [not](+1) a [fantasy](-1)...

He is a [possibility](+2).

But he [requires](/rɪˈkwaɪərz/) a [sacrifice](+2).

You have to sacrifice the [boy](-1).

You have to sacrifice the [comfort](-1)...

You have to sacrifice the [excuses](-1).

You have to [kill](+2) the part of you that wants to be [saved](-1).

[No](/noʊ/) one is coming to [save](/seɪv/) you.

[Adler](/ˈædlər/) taught that all problems are interpersonal problems...

But the solution is individual [responsibility](+2).

You must [BECOME](+2) self-reliant...

You must [BECOME](+2) [Sovereign](/ˈsɒvrɪn/).

The [Sovereign](/ˈsɒvrɪn/) individual does [not](+1) ask for permission...

He [ACTS](+2).

He does [not](+1) wait for the "right feeling." He [ACTS](+2).

He [BUILDS](+2) his world from the inside out.

This [Vision](+1) must be crystal clear...

What does your house look like?

Who is your woman?

What is your [mission](+2)?

If you don't know, you can't get there.

You need a [map](+1)...

And the map is the [Vision](+2).

When you have a clear [Vision](+1), the pain of the moment becomes [irrelevant](-1)...

You [are](+1) [not](+1) "suffering" through the gym...

You [are](+1) [becoming](+1) the [Vision](+1)...

The [suffering](/ˈsʌfərɪŋ/) has a [purpose](+1)...

That is [Teleology](/ˌtɛliˈɒlədʒi/).

Remember the [switch](+1) I told you about?

The one that [flips](+1)?

It happens when the [fear](+1) of the [Anti-Vision](/ænˈtiˈvɪʒən/) meets the [pull](+1) of the [Vision](+1).

When staying the same becomes more [terrifying](+2) than the pain of change.....

That is when you [become](/bɪˈkʌm/) [unstoppable](+2)...

That is when you [become](/bɪˈkʌm/) [dangerous](+2).

So how do we bridge the gap?

How do we get from the [Hell](-1) to the [Heaven](+2)?

[ACTION](+2).

But [not](+1) just any action...

[Teleological](/ˌtɛliˈɒl.ə.dʒikəl/) action.

Purpose-driven action.

Every single thing you do is a [vote](+1).

When you wake up and hit snooze, you [are](+1) [voting](-1) for the [Anti-Vision](-1).

When you wake up and get to work, you [are](+1) [voting](+1) for the [Vision](+1).

It is [binary](+1).

There [are](+1) [no](+1) [neutral](-1) actions.

You [are](+1) either [building](-1) the [prison](-1) or [building](+1) the [castle](+1).

The psychological [switch](+1) I mentioned earlier?

It is the moment you [realize](+1) this...

It is the moment you [realize](+1) that [EVERYTHING](+2) [matters](+2).

How you do anything [is](+1) how you do [EVERYTHING](+2).

If you [are](+1) [sloppy](-1) with your dishes, you [are](+1) [sloppy](-1) with your business.

If you [are](+1) [undisciplined](-1) with your diet, you [are](+1) [undisciplined](-1) with your finances.

It is all [connected](+1).

You must [BECOME](+2) the [observer](/əbˈzɜrvər/) of your own life.

Watch yourself...

Catch yourself.

"Why [am](/æm/) I doing this? What is the goal?"

"[Am](/æm/) I seeking [comfort](-1)? Or [am](/æm/) I seeking [growth](+1)?"

"[Am](/æm/) I [running](/ˈrʌnɪŋ/) from [fear](-1)? Or [am](/æm/) I [running](/ˈrʌnɪŋ/) towards [power](+1)?"

This [level](/ˈlɛvəl/) of self-awareness is [painful](+1)...

It is [exhausting](-1).

But it is the [price](+1) of [freedom](+2).

You have to [CHOOSE](+2) your [pain](+1).

The [pain](/peɪn/) of [discipline](+1)?

Or the [pain](/peɪn/) of [regret](-1)?

The [pain](/peɪn/) of [growth](+1)?

Or the [pain](/peɪn/) of [decay](-1)?

You [are](+1) [going](/ˈɡoʊɪŋ/) to [suffer](+1) either way...

[Life](/laɪf/) is [suffering](/ˈsʌfərɪŋ/).

But you get to [CHOOSE](+2) what you [suffer](/ˈsʌfər/) for.

[CHOOSE](+2) the [suffering](/ˈsʌfərɪŋ/) that leads to the [Vision](+1).

[CHOOSE](+2) the [struggle](/ˈstrʌɡəl/) that makes you [stronger](+1).

[CHOOSE](+2) the [path](/pæθ/) of the [King](+2).

So, how do we use this?

How do we [apply](/əˈplaɪ/) [Adlerian](/ædˈlɪəriən/) [Teleology](/ˌtɛliˈɒlədʒi/) right now?

Step [One](+1)...

Define the [Hell](+2).

Write it down...

Describe your life in 5 years if you do [not](+1) change...

Make it [disgusting](+2)...

Make it [terrifying](+2)...

Read it every morning...

Let it [haunt](+1) you.

Step [Two](+1)...

Define the [Heaven](+2).

Construct your Fictional Final Goal [(/fɪkʃənəl faɪnəl goʊl/)]...

The version of you that is [fully](/ˈfʊli/) [integrated](/ˈɪntɪɡreɪtəd/)...

The [King](+2)...

The [Magician](/məˈdʒɪʃən/)(+2)...

The [Warrior](/ˈwɔriər/)(+2)...

See him [clearly](+1).

Step [Three](+1)...

[ACT](+2) [Teleologically](/ˌtɛliˈɒl.ə.dʒikəli/).

Every time you face a choice, ask...

"Does this lead to the [Hell](-1), or the [Heaven](+1)?"

There is [no](+1) middle ground...

You [are](+1) either [moving](+1) towards the [Vision](+1), or you [are](+1) [sliding](/ˈslaɪdɪŋ/) into the [Anti-Vision](-1)...

[Entropy](/ˈɛntrəpi/) is [real](+1)...

Standing still is [moving](/ˈmuːvɪŋ/) [backward](-1).

Do [not](+1) just watch this...

[Pause](/pɔz/)...

Write down your [Hell](-1), and your [Heaven](+2)...

Right now...

Then [subscribe](/səbˈskraɪb/) if you [are](+1) [ready](+1) for [war](+2).

You [are](+1) [not](+1) a [VICTIM](-1) of your past...

You [are](+1) the [architect](/ˈɑrkɪtɛkt/)(+2) of your future.

[Adler](/ˈædlər/) said, "The only normal people [are](+1) the ones you don't know very well."

[STOP](+2) trying to be normal...

[Be](/bi/) [Great](+2).

The [fire](+1) is burning behind you...

The [mountain](+1) is ahead of you.

[Run](+2).
